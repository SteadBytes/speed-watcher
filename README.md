# Speed Watcher

Monitors internet speed and tweets your ISP when below threshold. https://twitter.com/Speed_Watcher

https://github.com/sivel/speedtest-cli is used for testing speeds.

https://github.com/tweepy/tweepy is used for accessing the [Twitter API](https://dev.twitter.com/rest/public)

:construction: This is a work in progress project and is not intended to be fully accurate/featured monitoring system. The project is a proof of concept and an interesting way to practice using Twitter API and building a robust Python application. There are practical flaws in its implementation. For example, speedtest-cli will use up bandwidth which will exasperate any low-speed issues.
